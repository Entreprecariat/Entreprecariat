Entreprecariat:&#x20;

* Phenomenon related to: young, technologies, information
*   Made by:&#x20;

    * Entrepreneur - definition
    * Precariat - definition

    But nothing of the two:

    * Entrepreneur of the self, nothing to invest in
    * Precariat never unemployed, or unemployed freelance (an unemployed that works constantly)
* Constant incertanty about the future - no long term perspective
* Communities as the centre -> they need places of research with high technologies, all the remaining is cut off
* Involving of women, changing the semanticity
* Power not money-related but information-related
