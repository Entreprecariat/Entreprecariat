# Outcomes and Insights

Given those analysis, we can inspect our results and make some inferences.&#x20;

It can be seen from our results that if from one hand our expectations have been largely confirmed, on the other some interesting pattern emerged, bringing to new questions and to possible future paths for further studies.&#x20;

As we observed from the results that came out from the data, and the largely agreement between the books both on thematics and entities involved, we decided to provide our results according to a double prospective: on one hand we sum up what are the evidences, on the other end we will provide some speculations made by absence. In this way, it is possible to make some insights on the actual reality on this phenomenon, giving a different and more inclusive point of view from the one given by the authors.
