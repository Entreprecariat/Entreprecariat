# Research Question 2

The information society is characterised by the "lack of sense" of which Bifo talks about.

Insights: The presence of precariat is typical of all the countries "existing under contemporary information capitalism" (Foti, 2013). The decision to juxtapose the document of "Entreprecariat" to other relevant documents on the field has been taken after operating with the [word embedding tests](../distant-reading.md). Transparency and reliability to exploit the hidden semantic structure in documents has been provided through the fine tuning of the parameters, set by subjective decision. It is important to state here that the LDA algorithm is stochastic, hence the corpus has been associated to 5 topics, each of which has generated 25 words, taken from the corpus itself.&#x20;

Answer: The topic detection has revealed and confirmed that Lorusso's work is one of the most authoritative in the field, if we want to talk about creativity, labour and geek economy. It must be said that the results of Topic Detection among documents are more eloquent than the book itself, if compared to the other masterpieces. The topics are so defined:

Topics have been detected as follows:

* Topic\_0: POLICY
* Topic\_1: SHARING\_ECONOMY
* Topic\_2: ENTREPRECARIAT\_LIFE
* Topic\_3: CAPITALISM\_CRISIS
* Topic\_4: ZEITGEIST

The life of the precarious worker is intertwined with its cornerstone of creativity and risk. The interesting fact is that, reading the words, it comes natural to identify a discourse about our times (the fact that the terms "migrant", "woman", "rights" are in the same topic, for example, denotes a file rouge to follow).
