# Research Question 2

The information society is characterised by the "lack of sense" of which Bifo talks about.

The presence of precariat is typical of all the countries "existing under contemporary information capitalism" (Foti, 2013). The inspecting on the work of Silvio Lorusso inside a larger corpus gave us the possibility to **generalize some underlying concepts and patterns** that are assumable by a close reading of "Entreprecariat" and were also emerged in a dispersed and less systematic way in the  [word embedding tests](../distant-reading.md).&#x20;

Transparency and reliability to exploit the hidden semantic structure in documents has been provided through the fine tuning of the parameters, set by **subjective decision**. It is important to state here that the LDA algorithm is stochastic, hence the corpus has been associated to **5 topics**, each of which has generated **25 words**, taken from the corpus itself.&#x20;

Answer: The topic detection has revealed and confirmed that Lorusso's work is one of the most authoritative in the field, if we want to talk about creativity, labour and geek economy. It must be said that the results of Topic Detection among documents are **more eloquent** than the book itself, if compared to the other masterpieces.

Topics have been detected as follows:

* Topic\_0: POLICY
* Topic\_1: SHARING\_ECONOMY
* Topic\_2: ENTREPRECARIAT\_LIFE
* Topic\_3: CAPITALISM\_CRISIS
* Topic\_4: ZEITGEIST

The list of the main word per topic can be download in .csv format here:

Insights: The life of the **precarious worker** is intertwined with its cornerstone of **creativity and risk**. The interesting fact is that, reading the words extracted with the topic modelling, it comes natural to identify in them a narrative of our times. It must be underlined the unpredictable showing up of the terms "migrant", "woman", "rights" inside the same topic, i.e. "Policy", since those are the same terms selected by the ONU for the 8th one of the 17 [Sustainable Development Goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable\_Development\_Goals) which were established by the [United Nations General Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United\_Nations\_General\_Assembly) in 2015 (the full title of the Target 8.8 is: "Protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers, including migrant workers, in particular women migrants, and those in precarious employment"). &#x20;

Relevant words generated in the second topic - SHARING ECONOMY - delineate some essential points connected to technology and society. **Digital platforms** are essential to develop the contacts of a **community**. The mission is intertwined with the **user** expectations, and every **service** is a response to a user's **call**. Business in the sharing economy usually have roots in startups or **crowd** based funding.

Topic_2, has been nominated "Entreprecariat Life" and is well connected to what states the Guardian: "Neoliberalism sees **competition** as the defining characteristic of human relations. It redefines citizens as consumers, whose democratic choices are best exercised by buying and selling, a process that rewards merit and punishes inefficiency. It maintains that “the market” delivers benefits that could never be achieved by planning." In the post-neoliberalist era, the entreprecariat relies on the **management** of his/her **creativity** to **model** the path to success.
