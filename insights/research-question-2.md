# Research Question 2

The information society is characterised by the "lack of sense" of which Bifo talks about.

Transparency and reliability to exploit the hidden semantic structure in documents has been provided through the fine tuning of the parameters, set by subjective decision. It is important to state here that the LDA algorithm is stochastic, hence the corpus has been associated to 5 topics, each of which has generated 25 words, taken from the corpus itself.&#x20;
