  Is it possible to determine the semantic area of 'entreprecariat' through the
  tools of distant reading? Is it possible to declare if it is a positive or
  negative phenomenon?

# Research Question 1

By means of the **Word2Vec model** provided by Gensim, we could make **inferences of similarities** between words. It emerges that the word _entreprecariat_ has a strong connection with the word _youth_ and a weak connection to the word _work_. Furthermore, by querying our model we found out that the ten words most similar to "enterprecariat" are the following:

The code with the queries is available on our Github [repository](https://github.com/Entreprecariat/Entreprecariat) or you can download it from there:

Answer: we can confirm our expectations, declaring that **entreprecariat is a different condition** compared to the traditional concepts related to the labour market. It is related to the concept of "precariaty" and "precariousness", but also to some negative adjectives as _panic_ and _inability_.&#x20;

Insights: since it is a phenomenon that our corpus relates strictly to the youth, what is not present are the adults, and even more the **elderly**. There is a higher probability that, since elderly started to work in previous circumstances, they had permanent contracts or a even if they are precarious, they change company and not the kind of job, **out of the flexibility** requested by the current market. They still relate to the old concept of 'precariat' as 'intermittent employment', while entreprecariat is more similar to a lifestyle. It is not related anymore to the kind of contract (fixed-term, permanent etc.) but to the fact that it permeates every aspect of the life of the worker.
