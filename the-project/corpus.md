# Corpus

We started with a very small corpus composed by the book "Entreprecariat", the articles of Silvio Lorusso where he promoted it, and the tweets that contained the word "enterprecariat". It counted:

* 1 book: 47775 tokens
* 2 articles: 2300 tokens
* 7 tweets: 220 tokens

We enlarged it, by examining the network of authors related to Silvio Lorusso, who published books related to the world of "precariat". In the end, our corpus counted:&#x20;

* 7 books: 410.999 tokens
* 2 articles: 2300 tokens
* 7 tweets: 220 tokens
