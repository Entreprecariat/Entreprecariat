# Research Questions

As a starting point for our research we wanted to analyse Silvio Lorusso's concept of Entreprecariat. Our research questions were:&#x20;

1. Is is possible to determine the semantic area of 'entreprecariat' through the tools of distant reading? Is it possible to declare if it is a positive or negative phenomenon?
2. Which are the main topics of Silvio Lorusso's book?&#x20;
3.  Is 'entreprecariat' an actual global phenomenon or it interests some specific actors?&#x20;

    Through the network analysis based on entity recognition, we will say the main cited actors in this new world of creative jobs, seeing if there are some main companies/people/places that are more involved then others.

Since 'entreprecariat' is a manifestation of today's difficulties to find a job, we decided to enlarge our research questions to a bigger corpus based on the definition of the actual precariat.&#x20;
